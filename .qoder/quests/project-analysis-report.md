# Project Analysis Report: Vibe-UI Data Analysis Tool

## 1. Overview

The current project is a React frontend application with a Python Flask backend that generates random data for visualization. The application currently has three main views:

1. Dashboard View - Displays data in charts and tables
2. Metrics Explorer - Allows users to explore metrics with filtering capabilities
3. Chat Assistant - Basic chat interface that can display data

The goal is to transform this application into an AI-powered data analysis tool with storytelling capabilities, advanced charting, and scheduled reporting features. The current architecture has a clear separation between UI (which handles visualization) and backend (which provides data processing capabilities), making it well-suited for enhancement with LLM integration.

## 2. Current Architecture

### 2.1 Frontend Architecture (React/TypeScript)

#### Technology Stack
- React 19.x with TypeScript
- Chart.js for data visualization
- CSS Modules for styling
- Vite as the build tool
- Context API for state management
- shadcn/ui components for enhanced UI elements
- Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- Radix UI for accessible component primitives

#### Component Structure
- **App Component**: Main application component handling tab navigation
- **Views**:
  - DashboardView: Main data visualization interface
  - MetricsExplorerView: Advanced metrics exploration
  - ChatView: Chat interface for data interaction

#### Data Flow
1. DataContext fetches data from backend API
2. Data is processed and made available to components via context
3. Components consume processed data for visualization
4. User interactions update context state, triggering re-renders

### 2.2 Backend Architecture (Python Flask)

#### Technology Stack
- Flask web framework
- Flask-CORS for cross-origin requests
- Random data generation for simulation

#### API Endpoints
- `/api/data`: Returns randomly generated datasets

The backend currently generates several types of random datasets:
1. Sales/Finance/Tech data with categories, regions, and values
2. Banking transaction data with transaction types and amounts
3. HR/recruitment data with candidate information
4. Department task data with completion rates
